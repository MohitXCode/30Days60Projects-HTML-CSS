## 💡 About The Challenge

This repository documents my journey of creating 60 mini web projects in just 30 days, focusing exclusively on HTML and CSS. The goal is to strengthen fundamentals, explore creative design patterns, and build a robust portfolio of frontend work.

Each project is designed to be:
- Completed in a single day (some days feature multiple smaller projects)
- Built with vanilla HTML and CSS (no frameworks)
- Focused on specific design patterns or CSS techniques
- Fully responsive and cross-browser compatible

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Master HTML5 semantic markup
- Develop advanced CSS styling techniques
- Improve responsive design skills
- Practice CSS animations and transitions
- Build a diverse portfolio of web components
